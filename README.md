# Skype-rust

Reimplementation (at first) of the work started here

  * https://github.com/msndevs/skylogin (in C)
  * https://github.com/uunicorn/pyskype (in python)

And the documentation of the latest skype protocol (actually MSNP24) here:

  * https://github.com/msndevs/protocol-docs

## Short term goal

There's only one at first

  * Making me play with rust

## Long term goal

Play on the hype and intrisic advantages of Rust to provide

  1. a safer/clearer/noob-friendly implementation of skylogin and faster than pyskype, while keeping a C ABI
  2. create a toy command line client for skype
  3. on the very longterm being able to live without the skype for linux binary

As the official skype for linux does not seem to get newer functionnality, right now it does not seem impossible to me to create something with a least more functionnality than the official linux client

## Contribution

Contribution are warmly welcomed, I'm totally new in Rust, so I don't mind PRs that points out I've made stupid mistake, don't assume it's a wizard trick.
